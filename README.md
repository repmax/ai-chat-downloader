# You Chat Extraction Utility
This devtool based extension graps the response data and a button in main window allows for copying to clipboard.

Ensure you're on you.com with a chat session in the active tab.

This tool triggers a page reload to force a full chat re-render in markdown format from the server.

Post-execution, two control buttons will manifest in the upper-left quadrant of the active tab, because information cannot be passed directly from DevTools panel.

Data Retrieval Options:

- Copy to Clipboard: Copy the chat as markdown to clipboard.

- Download File: Download the chat to a markdown file.

Prior to extraction, you can specify tags for inclusion in the markdown frontmatter. 

This feature is particularly beneficial for users leveraging advanced knowledge management systems like Obsidian for note organization and retrieval.
